This is the info file for CSCB07 lab 1 
the project involves creating a polynomial class that has an object of polynomial type 
The object is represented by a double array of coeffiecients 
In the class we create a number of functions to manipulate the polynomials
we create 2 constructors one of which is the default constructor that sets a polynomial oto zero the second constructor 
sets the polynomial equal to the input double array
The other functions in the class are : ADD- adds 2 polynomials and returns a polynomial;
Evaluate- returns a double value of the polynomial for a given input
The last function is has root that verifies is the given input a root of the polynomial and returns a boolean type value.
